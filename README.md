## Real Estate Manager

This is my personal project built as part of the **Redberry Challenge**. The goal was to create a real estate management web application where users can **add new properties**, **assign agents**, and **manage listings**. It showcases my ability to build clean, reusable components and implement modern web development practices using React and TypeScript.

- **React Router** â€“ for client-side routing
- **TypeScript** â€“ for type safety and better development experience
- **React Hook Forms** - for input validation
- **useContext** â€“ for managing global state
- **Styled Components** â€“ for modular and scoped styling
