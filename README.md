# 🌟 Real Estate Manager

This is my personal project built as part of the **Redberry Challenge**. The goal was to create a real estate management web application where users can **add new properties**, **assign agents**, and **manage listings**. It showcases my ability to build clean, reusable components and implement modern web development practices using React and TypeScript.
